# Shork ðŸ¦ˆ

**Note**: This project was archived due to my bad code style and lacking experience in language design :) . I do plan on rewriting this project eventually, maybe even soon, but it'll probably take a while.

A fishy try on interpreted programming languages and a tribute to the all loved IKEA shorki. Meant to be for easy developement of PoC exploits, but feel free to use it however you want (this also means that I am not responsible for ANYTHING you make with this!)

## What works atm?

- Expressions - congratulations, you have a calculator!

## Learn to wield the power of the shonk

To learn the language specs, feel free to take a look at the [docs](docs/0-Intro.md)! Code examples are in the ```shork-examples``` folder, although some features they use may not work because I havent implemented them yet. To know which features work, visit the [What works atm?](#what-works-atm) section above.
